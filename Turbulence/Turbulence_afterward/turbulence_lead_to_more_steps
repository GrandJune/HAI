We implement a post-learning turbulence shock to test the generalizability of the agents’ internal representations.
While organically trained agents continue to perform reasonably, those guided by algorithmic advice show a pronounced decline
—despite flawless historical performance
—highlighting the brittleness of shortcut-based learning under environmental change.
